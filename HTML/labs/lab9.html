            <h3>Tulip Flowers</h3>
            <p>
                The tulip is a Eurasian and North African genus of perennial, bulbous plants in the lily family.
                It is an herbaceous herb with showy flowers, of which around 75 wild species are currently accepted.

            <h4>Tulip Festival</h4>
            <p>
                <b>
                    The Skagit Valley Tulip Festival is one of the destination events for the Pacific Northwest,
                    held from April 1-30. Every spring hundreds of thousands of people come to enjoy the celebration
                    of spring as millions of tulips burst into bloom. As with all things governed by Mother Nature,
                    the tulips bloom according to their own schedule sometime during the festival. The tulips allow us
                    to share our corner of the world and showcase Skagit Valley agriculture. We depend on a strong
                    volunteer base to keep our office up and running and to put on our festival activities.
                    This year Skagit Valley Senior Village has stepped up to sponsor our Volunteer program which
                    logged nearly 1,400 hours in 2014.

                    Our festival is designed as a driving tour for the visitor as there is no one "site"
                    that you go to for your visit. The fields of tulips are scattered throughout the Skagit Valley
                    as are the many events and activities that comprise the festival. The tulip fields are the crops of
                    RoozenGaarde/Washington Bulb Co., Inc. and Tulip Town and the fields are different each year due
                    to crop rotation. Both RoozenGaarde and Tulip Town also have displays of tulips in gardens for
                    visitors to view and photograph. We hope you enjoy taking in one of the many events and activities
                    that happen only during April.

                    As the festival continues on its journey – now for 32 years – we welcome people from across the
                    United States and from around the world. The beauty of the flowers truly transcends differences,
                    bringing cultures, ages and diverse lifestyles together to marvel at nature's creation.
                    In 2014 we were proud to greet visitors from all 50 states and from 85 foreign countries.
