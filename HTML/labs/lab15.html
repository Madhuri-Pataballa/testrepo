                collaboration between Danny Boyle, Aaron Sorkin, and Michael Fassbender is
                worthy of all the advanced attention that Steve Jobs has received, and we freely admit that we're so,
                so happy we've never seen that Ashton Kutcher movie so our imagination is free from bad movie-going
                experiences and having to make any comparisons. Also, we don't have to sit through anything about iOS 9
                or the Apple Watch‎.

            <b>About Steve Jobs :</b>

            With public anticipation running high, Apple Inc. co-founders Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) and Steve "Woz"
            Wozniak get ready to unveil the first Macintosh in 1984. Jobs must also deal with personal issues related to
            ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan and their young daughter Lisa. Eventually fired, Jobs launches NeXT Inc.
            and prepares to release a new computer model in 1988. Ten years later, Jobs is back at Apple Inc. and about
            to revolutionize the industry once again with the iMac.
            <br />
            It would be a stretch to call Steve Jobs a biopic in any traditional sense, as it never delves deeply into Jobs’
            life. Instead, Sorkin divides the film into three acts, focusing on a trio of pivotal product launches from Jobs’
            career — namely, the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998. Cleaving to this structure
            lets the The West Wing writer do what he does best: write electric dialogue for actors walking up and down hallways.
            Each scene involves the problem of getting a product launch off the ground, with Jobs and his indefatigable right
            hand Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) contending with venue logistics, malfunctioning hardware, and an inner circle
            that Jobs can’t help but alienate, all in the name of moving mankind forward.

            <b>Make no mistake:</b>
            This is unquestionably a Sorkin film, featuring everything from the ping-ponging dialogue to the
            almost-romance between the male and female leads. The script flies along at a terrifically engaging pace,
            capturing the spirit of a tech launch — the high anxiety, the frayed nerves — beautifully, landing somewhere
            between The Social Network and Birdman. And under Boyle’s stylish direction, what might otherwise be a stage
            play turns into a visual tour de force, flitting from grainy 16mm in 1984 to theatrical 35mm and hyper-polished
            HD with each passing era. Keep in mind that the movie doesn’t concern itself too heavily with the factual
            particulars of the products being launched. (Probably ideal, since Isaacson got so much about Jobs’
            actual work wrong.) Instead, the beauty of Steve Jobs is that it uses computers as catalysts, enabling
            Sorkin to bend Jobsian lore to his will and set off fireworks between his characters.
