        <p>
            Sushi is a Japanese food consisting of cooked vinegared rice combined with other ingredients, seafood,
            vegetables and sometimes tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation vary widely, but
            the ingredient which all sushi have in common is rice

        <h2>TIPS TO MAKE YOU A SUSHI EXPERT</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Sit at the bar : </b><br />
                90% of a sushi chef's work happens before the restaurant even opens. For a chef, the prep is the
                practice, and the service is the performance. It's best to get a front-row seat rather than slumming
                it in the nosebleeds. You'll get a stronger appreciation of the care that goes into your food, and
                no one has more knowledge of the menu and freshness of the fish than the chef. Also, a few friendly
                questions and a genuine interest will likely earn you free food.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Trust your server :</b> <br />
                It is their job to make sure you have a good experience, so don't make it hard for them.
                If you're feeling brave, then order "omakase" style ("I'll leave it to you") and let the chef
                make the decisions. But whether you're ordering a la carte or letting the chef pick, offer your
                server suggestions of what you like in terms of texture and intensity. If you're not into creamy,
                rich fish, you probably won't want to end up with a mouthful of urchin genitals.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Don't be afraid to ask questions :</b> <br />
                Odds are your server didn't know anything about sushi when they started working in the industry,
                so don't feel embarrassed if you don't have a nuanced understanding of the difference between blue and
                yellowfin tuna, or don't have three semesters worth of Japanese language classes under your kimono.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Don't order everything at once :</b> <br />
                Rattling off a super-complex order of sashimi and nigiri might make you think you look like a pro,
                but it isn't how pros actually do it. Order a few things at once, and your honest reactions will help
                guide your server to make sure you're getting flavors that match your palate.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Don't ask for soy sauce and wasabi if they're not served : </b><br />
                Most sushi chefs aren't too into the idea of you giving their carefully made creations a bath
                in a pool of soy sauce. It overwhelms the flavors, and chances are the chef already gave it a
                delicate brush of soy. Wasabi and ginger are used as palate cleansers, not entrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Avoid flashy rolls : </b><br />
                Rolls with lots of different kinds of fish or rainbow sauces are generally frowned upon by experts
                because it's hard for the individual flavors to shine. The chef we talked to recommends basic tekka
                maki (tuna roll), umeshiso maki (a roll with plum paste and shiso leaves), or a California roll with
                real crab.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Seek out the specialties : </b><br />
                Ask what the restaurant is known for, or if there are dishes that are particularly indicative
                of the restaurant's style. It will be viewed as a sign of respect and also allow the chef to put
                his best foot forward.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>When in a traditional sushi bar, sashimi should be ordered before sushi :</b> <br />
                This comes from Morimoto camp, so you know it's ironclad. Work your way up to rolls: they're considered
                the main course. And while it seems like you might want to start with a bowl of miso, traditional chefs
                would serve this last.

        <h2>18 WAYS THAT GROCERY STORE SUSHI IS DIFFERENT FROM SERIOUS SUSHI</h2>
        <h3>The Rice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>It's too mushy... or too dry</b><br />
                The rice is likely cooked with too much water, leading to an initial texture more akin to baby food.
                But after a few hours in a cold case, that roll will be dry as a bone.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The temperature is wrong</b><br />
                Sushi rice should be served close to body temperature and kept slightly warm until being served.
                That's not happening in a grocery store.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The flavor of the rice is off</b><br />
                Grocery store sushi rice is usually cooked with much more vinegar and sugar, often a pre-mixed ratio,
                leading to more overpowering rice that attempts to make up for less flavorful fish.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The rice loses its integrity</b><br />
                Decent sushi chefs don't view the rice as one ring of starch, they think of each grain as separate.
                Over time those grains of rice cease to be unique snowflakes and conform into one bland snowman.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The rice isn't packed right</b><br />
                The chef makes a decision with each piece of sushi as to how tight to pack the rice.
                Generally it's so loose that it'll be falling apart by the time it reaches your mouth, but with
                cheaper sushi that level of care isn't taken.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Fish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Raw fish loses flavor when chilled</b><br />
                Once a sushi chef's hands have cut and formed the fish over rice, the fish has been slightly warmed.
                Those few moments of handling greatly increase the flavor, a personal touch that your grocery case
                cannot provide.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The fish is coming from bigger suppliers</b><br />
                High-end sushi bars will have very intimate relationships with their suppliers, who are only
                selling the best of the best. Grocery stores are still getting quality fish, but it's not as
                meticulously graded on taste and texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The freezing technology is different</b><br />
                Most fish used in sushi these days is frozen at some point between the ocean and your mouth,
                but the technology varies widely. A well-frozen fish is dipped in liquid nitrogen and hits negative
                65 degrees instantly, leaving the flesh and muscles perfectly intact. However, cheaper methods of
                freezing will lead to water crystallization that is going to degrade the overall flavor. The flip
                side of this is that when high end restaurants do get fresh, never-frozen fish, there is a greater
                chance that the fish will be carrying parasites. So in theory, grocery store sushi could actually
                be considered less of a health hazard.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Seasonality isn't taken into account</b><br />
                Fish have different life cycles, so some will taste best at certain times of the year.
                A good sushi chef knows what's in season and will recommend it, whereas at grocery stores it's
                always spicy tuna season.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>You're more likely to be eating bogus fish</b><br />
                There's a big problem with grocery stores and crappy sushi bars mislabeling fish. This is more
                likely a supply chain problem than any unscrupulousness on the part of of the seller, but
                respected sushi joints won't get burned by their suppliers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Grocery store sushi is oxidized</b><br />
                The point of cutting sushi just before serving is that meat oxidizes when exposed to air, and
                the flavor deflates. No amount of loosely fitting plastic cover can keep that fish from turning
                sour once it's been cut.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>They're not starting from the whole fish</b><br />
                Cheaper places are starting from pre-cut fillets, and there's no telling if there is something
                about the whole fish that might cause a more experienced chef to discard it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Less flavorful fish are more common</b><br />
                Salmon and yellowtail are big sellers at grocery stores because they're fattier, less flavorful
                cuts whose melt-in-your-mouth qualities mix well with sweeter sauces.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Everything Else</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>The seaweed is just missing the point</b><br />
                Traditionally, seaweed should be dry and a bit crispy compared to the roll's softer contents.
                Refrigeration and the mushier rice cause it to lose its texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Most sushi chefs don't want to hide behind mayo</b><br />
                You'll see a nice rainbow of sauces drenching grocery store sushi, but most respectable sushi
                chefs would prefer that the diner is focusing on the fish rather than a zig-zag of mayo.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The ginger is mass produced</b><br />
                Most serious chefs will pickle their ginger in-house. Grocery store ginger tends to be mass
                produced and much sweeter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The wasabi isn't fresh (and might not even be wasabi)</b><br />
                The spice and flavor of real wasabi disappears within 10 or 15 minutes of grinding, so there's
                no way you're getting the real stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The soy sauce isn't custom</b><br />
                Like ginger, a legit sushi chef is probably using a custom blend of soy sauce that doesn't
                come out of a miniature packet.
            </li>
