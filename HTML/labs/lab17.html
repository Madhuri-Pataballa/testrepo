            <h2 id="hstyle">The Dangers of Evil Twin Wi-Fi Hotspots</h2>
            <div>
                <p style="font-size:larger">
                    As mobile workforces grow and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) initiatives expand across the enterprise, so does the
                    threats associated with remote access. New attack vectors are on the rise and hotspots are
                    becoming less safe for remote workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Evil Twin hotspot is a Wi-Fi access point set up by a hacker or cybercriminal.
                    It is meant to mimic a legitimate hotspot provided by a business, such as a coffee shop
                    that provides free Wi-Fi access to its patrons.<br />
                    An Evil Twin hotspot mimics a legitimate hotspot in just about every way, but its intentions
                    are more sinister in nature.<br />
                    Hackers and/or cybercriminals create Evil Twin hotspots to allow them to both eavesdrop on
                    network traffic and insert themselves into the data conversation between the victims and the
                    servers that the victims access while connected to the Evil Twin hotspot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By imitating a legitimate hotspot and tricking users into connecting to it, a hacker or cybercriminal
                    can then steal account names and passwords and redirect victims to malware sites, phishing sites, etc.
                    The perpetrators can also view the contents of files that the victims download or upload while they are
                    connected to the Evil Twin access point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Victims that connect to Evil Twin hotspots don't even know that they are connecting to a rogue access
                    point because the perpetrators use the SSID (network name) of the legitimate access point. The whole
                    experience is transparent to the victim. Most of the time the hacker allows the victims to reach their
                    intended Internet destinations while they secretly eavesdrop on the network traffic so that they can
                    steal the information from the victims as the victims attempt to login to their e-mail, provide credit
                    card numbers while shopping online, etc..

            <h2 id="hstyle">How can we Tell if we'r Connecting to an Evil Twin vs. a Legitimate Hotspot?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    We likely won't be able to tell whether we are connecting to a good hotspot or a bad one.
                    Hackers will make every effort to use the same SSID name as the legitimate access point.
                    They often go a step further and clone the MAC address of the true access point so that
                    they will be seen as a Base Station Clone which further strengthens the illusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Evil Twin hotspot owner may attempt to boost his or her hotspot's signal strength so
                    that it overpowers the legitimate one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hackers don't have to setup a big ugly hardware-based access point to create an Evil Twin hotspot.
                    Hackers can use hotspot emulating software that utilizes the Wi-Fi network adapter in their notebook
                    PC as the hotspot. Having this level of portability and concealment allows them to position themselves
                    nearer to a potential victim which may help them to overpower the signal coming from the legitimate
                    access point.

            <h2 id="hstyle">The best defense starts with a good Offense.</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Public hot spots all have one thing in common; they are open networks that are vulnerable to attacks
                    and security breaches. Most, if not all, public hot spots do not encrypt data, allowing passwords,
                    email messages, and other information to be intercepted by nefarious types. The best defense starts
                    with a good offense, in this case that means educating the user or creating automated policies on
                    devices to prevent interception.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Disable WiFi adapters by default: In other words, keep Wi-Fi shut off until it is needed,
                        change the default settings on the device to disable Wi-Fi, forcing users to turn it on when needed.
                        That way users are kept in the know, at least when they are actively using a Wi-Fi hotspot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enforce HTTPs: Simply put, HTTPs (SSL) connections are more secure than open HTTP connections and
                        bring added protection to sessions. Requiring that any company resources are only accessed via HTTPs
                        (or VPN) reduces the possibility of data being intercepted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Incorporate a local firewall: Many OSes today come with a software firewall either built-in or
                        readily available as a download. Installing a firewall on the client device, along with enforcing
                        antivirus policies can prevent malware from infecting devices and can stop data interception attempts
                        by blocking suspicious traffic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Validate connections: Many public hot spots have multiple wireless networks and knowing which one
                        to connect to could be the difference between a secure session, or a session that exposes critical
                        information to interception. Luckily, some OSes incorporate hot spot profile settings, which will
                        automatically inform the user of what wireless networks are available and what ones they can connect to.
                        In the best case scenarios, users are automatically prompted to approve new WiFi connections, and once
                        approved, can then assign a profile for future use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use a VPN: Perhaps that is a no brainer, but many organizations still leave some applications
                        open to non-encrypted traffic to ease mobile worker woes. However, that ease of use can come at a
                        high price, one where data can be intercepted and corporate resources infiltrated. The simple solution
                        here is to make sure all corporate resources can only be accessed remotely via a VPN connection.
                        While that may require a user to log in numerous times (first into the hotspot, then into the VPN and
                        then into the application), VPNs can protect data from interception and networks from compromise.
                    </li>

            <h2 id="hstyle">What can We do to Protect Ourself From Evil Twin Hotspots?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    There aren't a lot of ways to defend against this type of attack. You would think that wireless
                    encryption would prevent this type of attack, but according to Watchguard, they are not an effective
                    deterrent because Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) doesn't encrypt user data until after the association
                    between the victim's network device and the access point has already been established.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the ways suggested by the Wi-Fi Alliance to protect ourself from Evil Twin access points
                    is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Using the encrypted tunnel provided by the VPN encryption
                    process helps to secure all traffic between your VPN-capable device and the VPN server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) used to be a luxury that only large corporations could afford to provide
                    their employees, but now personal VPN services are plentiful and cheap, starting at around $5 a month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than avoiding open public hotspots, we can help reduce the eavesdropping risk associated with
                    Evil Twin hotspots by only logging into our e-mail and other sites via HTTPS secured pages instead of
                    using HTTP unencrypted. Sites such as Facebook, Gmail, and others feature HTTPS login options.

                    I have used many times a Wi-Fi hotspot at Airports. But what is, I never went into trouble. <br />
                    As, now I got to know about the risks and troubles while using WIFI HotSpot, I would rather avoid using
                    Wifi at public places. I will TURN-OFF Automatic Wifi Connectivity.
