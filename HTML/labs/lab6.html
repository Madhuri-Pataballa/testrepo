        The <i><b>National Football League (NFL)</b></i> is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams,
        divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).
        The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest
        professional level of American football in the world.

        The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team
        playing sixteen games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from
        each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination
        tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.

        The <b>NFL</b> was formed in 1920 as the <i>American Professional Football Association (APFA)</i> before renaming itself
        the <i><b>National Football League</b></i> for the 1923 season. The NFL agreed to merge with the <i>
            <b>
                American Football
                League (AFL)
            </b>
        </i> in 1966, and the first <i>Super Bowl</i> was held at the end of that season; the merger was
        completed in 1970. Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the
        world and is the most popular sports league in the United States. The <i>Super Bowl</i> is among the biggest club sporting
        events in the world and individual Super Bowl games account for many of the most watched television programs in American
        history, all occupying the Nielsen's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015.
        The NFL's executive officer is the commissioner, who has broad authority in governing the league.
