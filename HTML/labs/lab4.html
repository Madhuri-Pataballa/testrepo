        <font size="4">
            I have searched many websites. Then I have picked two sites, one which <i>I like</i>, and other which <i>I don't</i>.
            So, below are the links to the sites that I'm going to talk about.
        </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all I'm going to discuss about the link that I don't like.
        <a href="http://www.autosysinc.com/">Visit AutoSys here!</a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <i>
                <font size="3" ; color="#228B22">
                    When you open it for the first time, it's look completely messy. It could be structured in a better way.
                    Here we see all the other stuff like, offers, appreciations, Awards and all romming all around the page.
                    It could be arranged in the seperate button, or the link.
                    And in my view, the heading of the site <b>"AUTOSYS"</b> should be coded a little bit smaller font.

    <p>
        Now here is the one which I like.
        <a href="https://www.genejuarez.com/">Hey I'm GeneJuarez!</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            <font size="3" ; color="#B22222">
                Whe it come's to GeneJuarez, it is well arranged and looks decent and neat. It's not at all messy. even the
                images were arranged well. The way they coded the sliding images on the Home page itself indicates the thought
                of the site completely.
                And they have different navigation menu, that takes the user to the choice they wish.
                And in my view, this site page <b>"Genejuarez"</b> is well organized.
