            <dd>
                Actually we went there for a vacation. We rented a motor boat for 3 days. We were almost there, and unfortunately we had
                a problem with the boat. We some how managed to get there, as we are almost at our final destination point.
                There was no means of any communication. <br />
                But it was real fun. We enjoyed every moment. As we took everything with us
                including food and other stuff, we couldn't find it hard. On the 2nd day, another family came in for camping.
                They helped us to come through it. 
                <br />
                We took camping gear, food, water, cooking kit and some blankets along with medical first-aid kit.
