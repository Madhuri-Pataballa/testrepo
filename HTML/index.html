         My name is <b>Sita Ratnam Madhuri Pataballa</b>
        Im plannig to setup my own <i><u><b> Event Planning Management Company </b></u></i>. So here is the description.
        Everyone has visions of an event planner at her actual event; walking around, smiling, getting credit 
        for putting on this fantastic party, meeting, or gala. She's simply basking in the glow of a job well 
        done, wine glass in hand, and loving that she's getting to party for a living and not sitting in a cubicle.<br />
        I hate to burst your bubble,<big><i><b> but this couldn't be any further from the truth! </b></i></big> The reality of an event planning 
        job description is so very different.
